### Introduction to MOP

The main aim of MOP is not only to be a player and media organizer 
but also to serve as framework to develop a custom experience and to
extend the base project according to each individual need. To achieve that
MOP is built with an Actor system to allow external communication and with 
a Plugin system to allow anyone to extends and interact with its parts.
